        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">2. Use License</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the Bot for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license, you may not:</p>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-8 mb-4">
            <li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
            <li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);</li>
            <li>attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained in the Bot;</li>
            <li>transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by the Bot owners at any time.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">3. Disclaimer</h2>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">4. Limitations</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">In no event shall the Bot owners or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the Bot, even if the Bot owner or an authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">5. Accuracy of Materials</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">The materials appearing in the Bot could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors.

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">8. Governing Law</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">These terms and conditions are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Bot owners reside, and you irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that State or location.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">9. Contact Information</h2>
